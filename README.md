# CodeBean-JavaQuizProject

# CodeBean is a Java-based GUI quiz application built with a focus on simplicity, aesthetics, and user experience. Designed to be stress-free and engaging, CodeBean blends the logic of programming with a cozy visual identity inspired by coffee, warmth, and Mr. Bean’s teddy.  

# Project Goal: To create a quiz interface that feels fun, calming, and easy to use — a break from overwhelming or overly gamified platforms like Kahoot or Blooket.

# Features:
  # Java-threaded timer with auto-submission
  # JUnit-tested scoring logic and edge cases
  # Leaderboard sorted by score and time taken
  # Custom coffee bean cursor and calm UI theme
  # Post-quiz display of incorrect answers for learning
  # Clean screen transitions and improved layout
